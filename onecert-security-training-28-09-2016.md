Google Chrome and Firefox are the your best options for a secure browser. It would be wise to install the HTTPS Everywhere extension, which is available for Chrome and Firefox.

# _**Tracking**_

If you would like to take your privacy even further, consider enabling the _Do Not Track_ feature in your browser. Websites can collect and track your browsing data, which can be done for beneficial purposes like improving security but there is no way for a user to know how their data is being used. To enable _Do Not Track_, do the following:

---

# In Chrome:
  1. On your computer, open Chrome. 
  2. At the top right, click More and then **Settings**.
  3. At the bottom, click **Show advanced settings**.
  4. Under "Privacy," check or uncheck **Do Not Track**.

  3. Click **manage your Do Not Track settings**.
  4. Check **Use Do Not Track**.
  5. Close the _about:preferences_ page. Any changes you've made will automatically be saved.

#_**Back up**_ your data
Have a recovery system in place so a ransomware infection can't destroy your personal data forever. It's best to create two back up copies: one to be stored in the cloud (remember to use a service that makes an automatic backup of your files) and one to store physically (portable hard drive, thumb drive, extra laptop, etc.). Disconnect these from your computer when you are done. Your back up copies will also come in handy should you accidentally delete a critical file or experience a hard drive failure.

---

#**Use robust _antivirus software_**

to protect your system from ransomware. Do not switch off the 'heuristic functions' as these help the solution to catch samples of ransomware that have not yet been formally detected.

---

#**Keep all the software on your computer up to date.** 
When your operating system or applications release a new version, install it. And if the software offers the option of automatic updating, take it.

---

#**Enable the 'Show file extensions' option in the Windows settings on your computer.** 
This will make it much easier to spot potentially malicious files. Stay away from file extensions like '.exe', '.vbs', and '.scr'. Scammers can use several extensions to disguise a malicious file as a video, photo, or document (like hot-chics.avi.exe or doc.scr).

---

# **If you discover a _rogue_ or _unknown_ process on your machine,** 

disconnect it immediately from the internet or other network connections (such as home Wi-Fi) - this will prevent the infection from spreading.

---

#**_Ending_ your session on the server**

Please sign out of Windows when ending your session on the server instead of simply closing the RDP window and disconnecting. When you disconnect your session is still technically active and could attract unwanted visitors to our server.
